## Hands On Spatial Data !!

Since you learned a bit about Azure Orbitals, it's time to use the geospatial data in real-time.
To start from scratch we will first install the Anaconda üêç (open-source) <br>

1. Install the Anaconda version suitable for Windows/Mac OS : https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/  <br>
2. Open the https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ and download the .tif file from the option landstat (image).  <br>
3. Once the Anaconda version is installed open Anaconda Prompt and install the following:  <br>
a) conda install -c conda-forge/label/dev rasterio  <br>
